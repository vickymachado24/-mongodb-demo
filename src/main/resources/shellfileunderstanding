#mongosh shell idea

# connect to the mongodb
# make sure to have a mongodb server running
& mongosh installed

mongosh (default mongodb URL ) OR mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017" (mongosh equivalent)
OR mongosh --port 28015 (manual port other than default)


# show the list of the databases
show dbs

## to switch to the databases create a new databases if does not exist
use <database_name>

## how to delete a db
db.dropDatabase()

## show collections within the selected DB
show collections

## to use any collections within a DB
db.<collecction_name>

## delete a collection within a DB
db.<collection-name>.drop()


## how to insert a document
##inside {} should be a JSON format object
## if no collection exists, automatically inserts one with the command

db.<collections_name>.insertOne({})

## insert many documents in an array of different objects
db.<collections-name>.insertMany({}, {})


## to find all document within a collection in db
db.<collection-name>.find()


## find with certain filters and multi filters are comma separated
db.<collection-name>.find( { filter-key:"filter-value", filter-key: int-filter-value })

## find with filters and retrieve only the data which you want by passing the second argument
## can keep the first argument empty if you dont want to perform filtering
db.<collection-name>.find( { filter-key:"filter-value", filter-key: int-filter-value },
{key-of-the-data-you-want:1, key-of-the-data-you-want2:1} }

## if you want the particular object associated with the id
db.<collection-name>.findOne( {_id: entire-object-value-of-the-document})

## chaining functions on document

##gives the count of the resultant of the query
count()

##gives the value number of documents only
limit(value)

##sort by which field
## note the sorting is done by the value of 1 and -1
sort( {sort-by-ascending-order-key:1, sort-by-ascending-order-key:-1 } )

## operators

## $gt strictly greater than the value
## $gte greater than or equal to the value
db.<collection-name>.find({rating : {$gt:7}})

## $lt strictly less than the value
## $lte less than or equal to the value
db.<collection-name>.find( {rating: {$lte:8}})

## $ne is for not equals


## $or for multiple hits, will be require to add in an array of operator objects
## can be applied on the same filter key or different
db.<collection-name>.find( {$or :[ {filter-key1 : {$gt : filter-value2}}, {filter-key2: "filter-value2"} ])


## $in operator specially in ranges instead of doing or on multiple or for the same key
db.<collection-name>.find({ filter-key1 : {$in : [values-as-comma-separated-values]}})

## $nin operator does the reverse of $in

## querying in arrays
## normal querying with find will directly find the match as per the specified value if the value of
## the key is not an array
## but if it is an array, then the provided filter value will be checked for its presence in the
## values mentioned in the array of that key
db.<collection-name>.find( {array-filter-key : "value"} );


## if you want the only type filtering for arrays, where you want to grab documents
## whose value is strictly only the value mentioned in the filter
## it should be mentioned in an array object
## can add many values in the array
db.<collection-name>.find( {array-filter-key : ["value"]})

## want to filter where you find documents which match the array values you mentioned
## but can have other values too

db.<collection-name>.find( {array-filter-key : {$all : ["value1", "value2"]}})
## NESTED DOCUMENTS finding ##
##the value of the key could be an array or another document itself
## want to find data in a nested document make sure the key this time is in double quotes
db.<collection-name>.find({"parent-key-filter.child-key-filter": "value"})


##delete one document
db.<collection-name>.deleteOne( {_id : value-of-key-of-object})

## delete many documents same as find filter
db.<collection-name>.deleteMany( {delete-filter-key :"value"})

##updating documents
##updating by object id is better as the value is unique, can be done with filters as find
## but if filter results are multiple, then the update will be carried out on multiple documents
## first object for filtering, and second object will be using a $set operator to changes
## values for multiple keys in the document, comma separated values
## if key is not present, then new key will be added

db.<collection-name>.updateOne( {_id : value-of-key-of-object}, {$set : {to-update-key1 :value
, to-update-key2: value } } )

$unset does the reverse of set, it removes the key itself from the document
similarly with updateMany()

## incrementing a value
$inc operator by some value
db.<collection-name>.updateOne( {_id : value-of-key-of-object}, {$inc : {to-update-key1 :value-to-increment-by} })

#similarly for $dec

$push and $pull perform addition and deletion of values within a  key
db.<collection-name>.updateOne( {_id : value-of-key-of-object}, {$pull : {existing-key : "value-to-remove"}} )

want to add multiple push and pull in single command

db.<collection-name>.updateOne( {_id : value-of-key-of-object}, {$push : {existing-key : {$each : ["value1","value2"]} )

## other operators are
$timestamp, $unset, $rename


#### Mongodb Aggregation pipelines
## Aggregation pipelines can have one or more "stages". The order of these stages are important. Each stage acts upon the results of the previous stage.

## function aggregate() takes an array of aggregation rules/stages
## each of the stage is a JSON object itself


db.posts.aggregate([
  // Stage 1: Only find documents that have more than 1 like
  {
    $match: { likes: { $gt: 1 } }
  },
  // Stage 2: Group documents by category and sum each categories likes
  {
    $group: { _id: "$category", totalLikes: { $sum: "$likes" } }
  }
])

## group aggregation helps to group the documents
## note that the _id here is different from the mongodb document id
## here the grouping is performed revolving around the unique values of the columns you want to group by
## note that the column name is preceded by the $ and enclosed in double quotes
## this will help us get multiple results with unqique values
db.<collection-name>.aggregate( { $group: { _id: "$column-name-for-grouping"}} )


# $limit helps to limit the number of document passed to the next stage

db.<collection-name>.aggregate( [{
    $group: { _id: "$category", totalLikes: { $sum: "$likes" } },
    {$limit : no-of-documents-to-pass}
}])


##$ project, passes only the fields to the next aggregation as mentioned, same as the second parameter for find
## note that the key you want to pass is within double quotes, 1 for the fields you want, 0 for the fields you dont want
db.<collection-name>.aggregate( [{
    $group: { _id: "$category", totalLikes: { $sum: "$likes" } },
    {$limit : no-of-documents-to-pass},
    {$project : {"field-you-want-to-pass1":1,
    "field-you-want-to-pass2":1}}
}])


# $sort same as sort() but the keys are within double quotes

# $matches as the same as find(), here keys are not within double quotes

## $addfields, adds news columns to the current aggregate stage

db.<collection-name>.aggregate( [{$match : {key-filter-1: {$gte: value-filter}}}, {$addFields : {name-of-the-field-to-add : {$avf : "$column-for-calculation"}}}])

## $count will give us the number of documents
## where we can specify the name of the column which will represent the count


##Aggregation $lookup
##This aggregation stage performs a left outer join to a collection in the same database.

##There are four required fields:

##from: The collection to use for lookup in the same database
##localField: The field in the primary collection that can be used as a unique identifier in the from collection.
##foreignField: The field in the from collection that can be used as a unique identifier in the primary collection.
##as: The name of the new field that will contain the matching documents from the from collection.

db.<collection-name>.aggregate( [{$lookup : { from : "name-of-collection-in-same-db", localField :"current-db-column", foreignField : "name-of-the-column-in-outer-collection"
  ,
  as :"name-of-the-field-you-want-to-display"}}])
